Buster ðŸ¤–
=============================================

About the project
-----------------
Buster is a library for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
It leverages LLMs and embeddings to provide answers to questions grounded in references.

Buster is open-source and hackable.
It includes many features out of the box, and is intended for deployment.


Demo
----

In order to demo Buster's abilities, you can play with our `live demo here <https://huggingface.co/spaces/jerpint/buster>`__.
We scraped the documentation of `huggingface ðŸ¤— Transformers <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__ and instructed Buster to answer questions related to its usage.
